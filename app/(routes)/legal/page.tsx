      q: "Terms and Conditions",
      a: "The creation of digital resources and collections through the process of digitization is an important aspect in the development of larger scale data collections that would allow researchers and developers access to various physical objects, access to which would otherwise be limited and/or become completely lost. With this in mind, KitsoHub is in the process of developing and reusing processes and standards that will allow us to create digital collections for the Botswana context in a systematic and sustained fashion to support both research activities in the field of digital humanities, and help institutions with limited resources in the development of digital collections. Although KitsoHub has a vested interest in access to large digital collections of data in Botswana heritage & languages, the focus of the portal is specifically on fostering access to digital resources that will support various types of research related to the use of Botswana languages. With this in mind, there are certain principles related to the digitization efforts of KitsoHub that are relevant to these guidelines. Firstly, the primary aim of the portal is access to digital language resources, and not on performing archival functions typically managed and implemented by libraries. The portal cannot, and should not, replicate the work already performed by various universities and libraries around the country. KitsoHub will rather focus on exploiting the resources that have already been developed for archival purposes, in order to facilitate research initiatives based on these digital resources. There are, however, several smaller institutions that do not have the necessary capacity in terms of technical knowledge to perform digitization activities, and in such cases, KitsoHub will try to support these institutions with technical and other resources, including the archiving and distribution of the digital resources. Secondly, KitsoHub will not necessarily determine the prioritization of digitization efforts. Instead, the portal will try to establish a framework and process for collecting and distributing metadata about physical objects that have not been digitized, and for which there is a need, from researchers, to have the objects digitized. This facilitation, in the form of a finding aid, will be an open Language Resource Index of various collections that may be digitized, where researchers can request the digitization of specific works. Based on these assumptions, the following guidelines are set out to provide the basic information and processes required to digitize an analogue source into a digital object that can be used in the creation of collections for access and research purposes. \n\n \n\n Digitization standards: \n\n According to Groenewald and Klapwijk (2010), a digital object is any self-contained unit of information in a digital format that consists of data and procedures required to manipulate the data. The digital object contains both the electronic data, in a suitable format according to the source, and the metadata associated with the object. Because the size and quality of a digital object is determined by the amount of information contained in the object, there are different digital formats for different types of digital objects, where the choice of formatting is dependent on the purpose and scope of the digitization effort. Since the aim of KitsoHub is not archival, the formats proposed in this guideline do not represent the highest quality digital objects, but rather those formats that allow digital access to the information contained in the original analogue version. Furthermore, KitsoHub is primarily interested in the preservation, distribution and access to language data, which implies that there are mainly two formats that are relevant to the digitization guidelines described here, namely text data, and audio data. \n\n \n\n Text data: \n\n The digitization of text data usually involves the scanning of a document into an image, conversion of the image into machine readable text through optical character recognition (OCR) and display in either JPEG or PDF formats with the associated text. The textual information is further enhanced by markup, usually in the form of metadata as described in the following section. The recommendations for the required formats are as follows: Scanning of master text image to TIFF 400 dpi; Conversion to JPEG/PDF; Optical character recognition with the relevant language model. Language models for the Botswana languages are available and can be adapted for specifically problematic texts; and Addition of relevant metadata. Audio data: Sound is stored in various file formats, many of which are software dependent, and this software may be proprietary. It is preferable that digital audio be converted to a format that is not in a proprietary format and can be reused with different software applications. The recommended format is lossless 24 bit/96kHz WAV format, which will be converted to MP3 format for web and research representations. The audio data must also be furnished with relevant metadata for access and discovery purposes."

      q: "Privacy Policy",
      a: "Data Access Policy:\n\n  KitsoHub is committed to the principles of open science. We feel it is especially relevant in the Botswana's context where ten of the eleven official languages are considered under-resourced. By making data from all eleven languages more readily available we are better able to support the development of our indigenous languages. Our data access policy was developed through wide consultation with a range of stakeholders.\n\n \n\n   Policy: \n\n KitsoHub is committed to applying the principles described in the OECD guidelines as far as possible, with consideration of the specific context of language resources and the Botswana context. The primary aim of the application of these principles will always remain the support of open and free exchange of ideas, information and knowledge, which broadens the scope and impact of the language resources developed and distributed by KitsoHub. The following policies address each of the OECD principles specifically in the context of KitsoHub. Openness: KitsoHub will make all language resources developed with KitsoHub funding available to researchers in Botswana, Africa, and internationally, at the lowest cost and under the most liberal open access license possible. The default distribution model within KitsoHub will be the Creative Commons Attribution only license, with no associated cost, even for commercial purposes. For resources that are distributed by KitsoHub, but not funded by KitsoHub, appropriate licensing options will be formalized with the owner of the resource to ensure that their ownership remains intact, but making the resource as widely available as possible. All language resources distributed by KitsoHub will be available from an online institutional repository that is available to the public without restriction. Any moratorium on data access will be applicable for a maximum of six months from submission, to allow principal investigators the opportunity to report on their resources, after which the moratorium will expire and data will be made available under the appropriate license. Only in exceptional circumstances will data be made available under restrictive licenses which limit the availability of the data to the public and research community. Flexibility: Given the ever-changing nature and unpredictability of information technology, legal practices, ethical matters, and research policy, methodologies and innovation, KitsoHub is committed to being flexible in terms of updating and integrating new knowledge, legal restrictions, and changes in regulatory environments in the implementation of this data access policy. KitsoHub will continue to review new technology, legislation, and scholarly environments to ensure that the language resources distributed by KitsoHub continue to serve the largest possible community. \n\n  \n\n Transparency:\n\n  KitsoHub will provide access to language resources in a transparent fashion, specifically communicating the origin, authorship, availability, etc. of the language resources in the metadata associated with all language resources. KitsoHub will also enforce the use of both national and international standards in the development and distribution of language resources as far as possible, given the regulatory environment and financial limitations of projects and resources associated with KitsoHub. Copyright: Since language resources are specifically based on language utterances in various formats, the restrictions placed on copyrightable material is of great significance to KitsoHub. In all cases, material that is distributed by KitsoHub will be reviewed to ensure that the material included in a language resource does not have copyright restrictions, or if there are restrictions, that the necessary copyright clearance from the rights holder has been attained. No material will be distributed where it is not clear that the copyright for the given resource has been resolved. Although every effort will be made to ensure that there is no copyright infringement in the language resources, the responsibility of infringement will remain with the party providing the language resources. In any case where there is uncertainty, or enquiries about a language resource, KitsoHub will cease to distribute the resource until such time as the matter has been resolved. All costs and legal services required to resolve the infringement will be the responsibility of the data provider, not KitsoHub. KitsoHub will also make the licensing of all resources clearly available through their distribution channels to ensure that data users are fully aware of any restrictions on the data. The user of the data will be liable for any infringement of the copyright arising from the failure of the user to abide by the terms of the license(s) associated with each resource. KitsoHub will not take copyright ownership of any language resource, unless specifically agreed to with the copyright owner, and will merely act as a distribution agent for language resources of which it is not the copyright owner. \n\n \n\n Protection of Personal Information:\n\n  KitsoHub will attempt, as far as it is possible, to ensure that any data developed or distributed by KitsoHub does not disclose any personal identifiable information of individuals, where the creators of the data have not received explicit permission to disclose such information, or where ethical clearance has been granted to do so.\n\n \n\n  Protection of Intellectual Property: \n\n All intellectual property (IP) vested in a particular language resource will remain the property of the creator/author of the resource, and in as far as KitsoHub has influence over the IP in a particular resource, KitsoHub will not divulge any IP not owned by KitsoHub. \n\n \n\n Formal Responsibility:\n\n  In order to ensure the legal distribution of language resources, KitsoHub will engage all parties that provide data to KitsoHub to enter into formal agreements that stipulate the specific conditions and time period under which the resources may be distributed by KitsoHub. These agreements will formalize the procedures for the submission, distribution, and ending of such agreements. A template for such a distribution agreement is available from KitsoHub on request. Quality: As with all data initiatives, the research and development that are applicable to any given data source is fully reliant on the quality of the data. KitsoHub will endeavor to ensure that resources developed for and distributed by KitsoHub are reviewed for quality based on industry standard quality metrics, which may include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-scores, Word error rates, and so forth. Wherever possible, the specific quality attributes to which a resource adheres will be communicated as part of the metadata associated with the data resource. KitsoHub will also work with language resource developers to ensure that the data standards that apply are well communicated and established prior to development efforts, and where possible, the evaluation procedures will also be made available to the public. KitsoHub will develop documentation on the techniques, methods and procedures that ensure high quality language resources and metadata, and will distribute such documentation publicly. Security: KitsoHub undertakes to ensure that all language resources and resource metadata are securely stored, with adequate backup, recovery and disaster management procedures for all data resources. As such, KitsoHub will distribute language resources across various virtual and physical domains to ensure that data is recoverable in a reasonable amount of time. KitsoHub also undertakes to put into place measures to ensure limited risk of unauthorized access or destruction of language resources under its stewardship. Accountability: The data access policies of KitsoHub, as well as the procedures, standards, and technologies implemented at KitsoHub will be reviewed by each of the respective management structures within KitsoHub to evaluate the effectiveness and relevance of the data access and management procedures."
